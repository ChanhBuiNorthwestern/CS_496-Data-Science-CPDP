# Check Point 1 Readme

Our Checkpoint 1 is for Relational Analytics (SQL) of our project. This checkpoints includes 4 questions that can be answered by SQL statements and statistics. Our questions focus on the theme of "officer-filed complaints", which is also our theme of the project. Our work include SQL codes and our analysis of the result from these SQL statements. Our questions are:
- What is the percentage of allegations filed by police officers?  
- What is the percentage of officers who resign after 2 years after receiving allegation reports made by another officer?  Normalized with the rate of how many officers resign after civilian complaints (% officers who resign 2 years after officer complaint) / (% officers who resign 2 years after civilian complaint)  
- What is the average age of officers when they have a complaint filed against them by another officer? (compare to overall average age)  
- What is the percentage of the complaints filed by officers that involve the use of  
force/firearms? For comparison, what is the percentage of the complaints filed by  
civilians that involve use of force/firearms?
