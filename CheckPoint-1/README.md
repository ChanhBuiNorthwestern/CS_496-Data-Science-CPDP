# Checkpoint 1: Relational Analytics

This checkpoint includes 4 questions that can be answered by SQL statements and statistics. Our questions focus on the theme of "officer-filed complaints", which follows the overall theme of our project. Our work includes SQL codes and our analysis of the results from these queries. Our questions are:
- What percentage of allegations are filed by police officers?  
- What is the percentage of officers who resign after 2 years after receiving allegation reports made by another officer?  Normalized with the rate of how many officers resign after civilian complaints (% officers who resign 2 years after officer complaint) / (% officers who resign 2 years after civilian complaint)  
- What is the average age of officers when they have a complaint filed against them by another officer? (compare to overall average age)  
- What percentage of the complaints filed by officers involve firearms? For comparison, what is the percentage of the complaints filed by civilians that involve firearms?
