# Check Point 3 Readme

Our Checkpoint 3 is for Interactive Visualization with D3.js of our project. This checkpoints includes 2 interactive visualizations that focused on individual officers and unit. With the theme of "officer-filed complaints", our first visualization aims to compare the officer-filed complaints and civilian-filed complaints for different district units. The 2nd visualization aims to look at officer-filed complaints for individual officers by different attributes.
Here is the description of our 2 visualization:

- Visualize police units on the map along with their officer-officer complaint stats. Specifically, when a police unit is clicked on, 2 pie charts of complaint categories for civilian-filed complaints, and a bar chart that highlights this unitâ€™s rate of officer-officer complaints (normalized by total shift hours) with all other units. And 2 line charts comparing how the normalized rates of officer complaints and civilian complaints (within the unit) compare over time. 
- Visualize the relationships between various attributes of an officer (age, rank, awards, # civilian complaints, years of service, etc.) and the likelihood of them receiving a complaint from another officer. Show a histogram where the y-axis is the number of officer complaints received, and let the user change the x-axis by clicking on different attributes of an officer to plot.
