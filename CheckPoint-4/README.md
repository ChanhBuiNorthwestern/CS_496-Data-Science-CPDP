# Check Point 4 Readme

Our Checkpoint 4 is for applying Machine Learning to look into a few specfic data trends. This checkpoint includes 2 types of machine learning tasks. 

- For the first task we used supervised learning to see if we could predict whether an officer who received a officer-filed allegation would receive a civilian-filed allegation within the next 2 years. We looked into specific demographics and attempted to collect information regarding the allegation and alleged officer. We trained serveral models in this portion of the checkpoint this included: logistic regression, decision trees, random forest, gradient boosting, and a neural network. 
- For the second task we used unsupervised learning in an attempt to classfy officers by using the features from our previous checkpoint (visualization). After finding the optimal number of clusters we looked into which features were most significant. For this model we used a library called K-Modes which enables categorical data to be pased into the k-means framework.
